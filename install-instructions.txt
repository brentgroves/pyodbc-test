Install the Microsoft ODBC driver for SQL Server (Linux) - version 18 works with Azure SQL, version 17 is needed for busche-sql. 

Configure the DSN for MSSQL brentgroves/pyodbc-test has /etc/odbc.ini for the system DSN and /usr/oaodbc81/odbc64.ini for the user DSN. 

Install the PROGRESS_DATADIRECT_OPENACCESS_OAODBC_8.1.0.HOTFIX_LINUX_64.tar Plex ODBC 64 Linux driver. 

Install ksh 

ksh unixpi.ksh 

Install will ask you for the following which I got from the linux drivers from Plex. (KEY = 35057920,COMPANY = BPG-IN,SERIAL = 004193623) 

Then update the /etc/odbc.ini and /usr/oaodbc81/odbc64.ini files with what is stored in the pyodbc-test repository. 

Source oaodbc64.sh script which exports common unixODBC environmental variables. 

run odbcinst â€“j to verify the environmental variables were set. 

Run python odbc-dsn-plextest.py to verify connection is ok.
